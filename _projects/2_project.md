Let's Chemi! is an educational puzzle game designed for the PC platform using Construct2 Engine. The game is based on junior high school chemistry curriculum content related to chemical reaction equations. Set in a chemistry lab, players take on the role of junior chemists. They must select the desired chemical product requested by the customer, choose suitable reactants based on basic chemical reaction principles, and then determine the correct reaction conditions to synthesize the target compound and deliver it to the customer. Through the entire process—from selecting reactants to synthesizing the compound—players engage in activities that help them memorize, understand, and practice basic chemical reaction equations.
