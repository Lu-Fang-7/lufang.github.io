👋Hi! I'm Lu Fang, and I'm currently a master student in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics'>Learning Anaytics</a> at TC. I earned my MEd in Science Education from <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University</a> and BS in Educational Technology from <a href="https://english.jiangnan.edu.cn/">Jiangnan University</a>.

👩🏻‍🏫As a CS/Science teacher, the most rewarding moments for me are hearing learners share their imaginative and creative ideas—and then helping them bring those ideas to life. In 2019, I led a team to develop and deliver CS courses to primary school learners in rural China. During this program, I also supported them in creating their own games using Scratch. This experience was pivotal in shaping my aspiration to pursue a career as a researcher.

📔As a researcher, I'm fascinated by how creating, interpreting, and visualizing data can enhance learner learning and support meaningful educational outcomes. I've developed educational games for junior middle school chemistry learners, learners of Chinese as a foreign language, and for implementation in science museums, which was also the focus of my M.Ed. thesis. My research interests lie in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game">Serious Games</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics">Learning Analytics</a>, and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> to inform education. 

🎮As a gamer, I regularly explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game">indie games</a>, and my favorite genre is <a href="https://screenrant.com/roguelike-roguelite-difference-permadeath-hades-rogue-slay-spire/">roguelite</a>.

☺️Lately, I’ve been actively working on my PhD applications for Fall 2026! And I'm always happy to connect ;)
