As a gamer, I regularly explore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game">indie games</a>, and my favorite genre is <a href="https://screenrant.com/roguelike-roguelite-difference-permadeath-hades-rogue-slay-spire/">roguelite</a>.

As a CS/Science teacher, the most rewarding moments for me are hearing my students share their imaginative and creative ideas—and then helping them bring those ideas to life.

As a researcher, I'm fascinated by how creating, interpreting, and visualizing data can enhance student learning and support meaningful educational outcomes. My research interests lie in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game">serious games</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_analytics">learning analytics</a>, and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> to improve education. 

Lately, I’ve been actively working on my PhD applications for Fall 2026! I'm always happy to connect ;)
